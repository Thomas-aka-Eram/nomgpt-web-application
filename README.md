# Nom GPT

Nom GPT is a hands-on project I am working on to gain practical experience with real-world applications. The project focuses on building a recipe recommendation system using AI and web APIs. It provides an opportunity for me to strengthen my understanding of AI generation, API integration, and UI styling. I reference the User Interface and application idea from ChefGPT.

## Project Overview

The main goal of **Nom GPT** is to generate personalized cooking instructions based on ingredients provided by the user. This project integrates the **Chef Transformer T5** model for AI-based recipe generation and uses the **Edamam Web API** to fetch recipe data. 

This project is a great exercise to learn about the end-to-end process of building a web application with complex functionalities, including interacting with APIs, working with machine learning models, and applying UI/UX principles.

## Learning Process

This project serves as a learning experience to:
- Work with the **Chef Transformer T5** model for AI-based content generation, improving my understanding of machine learning models and how they can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
- Integrate external data through the **Edamam Web API**, learning how to handle API responses, filter data, and use it in a real-time application.
- Utilize **CSS** to build an intuitive and attractive user interface. Through this, I aim to deepen my knowledge of UI/UX design and front-end development.

## Technologies Used

- **AI Model**: Chef Transformer T5 (for recipe generation)
- **API**: Edamam Web API (for fetching recipe data)
- **Frontend**: React, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)

## Features

- **Recipe Generation**: Generate personalized recipes based on the ingredients provided by the user.
- **Filter Options**: Filter recipes by diet, health considerations, cuisine, and more.
- **User Interface**: Clean and simple UI built using React and styled with CSS for a pleasant user experience.
